# Kurnik Journey

> From idea to product — building in public 🐔

The complete, documented journey of building [Kurnik](https://kurnik.ai) — an AI-powered product incubator where ideas come home to roost.

## What This Is

A public-facing site that captures every phase of building Kurnik: naming, brand identity, architecture decisions, tech stack choices, implementation, and launch. Every decision documented. Every iteration captured.

## Structure

```
site/                   Deployable site root (Netlify)
  index.html            Journey landing page
  brand-foundation.html Phase 01: Brand Foundation
  ...                   Future phases added here
```
